  Analyze this text and classify its characteristics.

  Text:
  "${text}"

  For each characteristic, answer with ONLY "yes" or "no":

  1. Is this an OPINION (personal view, belief, or judgment)?
  2. Is this an EXAMPLE (specific instance or illustration)?
  3. Is this an ANALOGY (comparison to explain something)?

  Format your response EXACTLY as:
  opinion: yes/no
  example: yes/no
  analogy: yes/no

  text: "I think AI coding tools are overhyped. They work well for boilerplate, but struggle with complex business logic."
